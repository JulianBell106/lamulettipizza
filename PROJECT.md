> - Pre-demo manual actions still outstanding — see checklist below.

## What is Stalliq?
Julian (Endoo Limited) is building Stalliq — a white-label PWA food ordering platform for independent mobile street food vendors. La Muletti Pizza (Daniele + Danielle, Bletchley MK) is the launch customer, on a free Year 1 Founding Customer deal.

---

## Demo with Daniele — ~2026-05-15

### Remaining pre-demo checklist (Julian — manual actions)
1. **Add composite index on `stalliq` dev Firebase project** — Firebase Console → stalliq project → Firestore → Indexes → Add: `orders` collection, `customerId` ASC + `createdAt` ASC. (Production index exists; dev index still missing.)
2. ~~Add image links to Street Stack menu sheet~~ ✓ Done 2026-05-09
3. **Wipe test data on stalliq-production** — Firebase Console: delete all docs in `orders` and `users` collections. Keep `vendors/{vendorId}/staff/` (staff PINs), `kitchenStatus`, `location`, `counters`.
4. ~~James's stamp count~~ ✓ Done 2026-05-10 — `stampCount` set to 0 in stalliq-production.
5. **ICO registration** — ico.org.uk, ~£40/year (Endoo Limited — required before collecting personal data in production).
6. **Google Sheet header rows** — protect header rows on all three La Muletti sheets.
7. ~~stalliq.co.uk demo tile~~ ✓ Fixed 2026-05-10 — full site rebuilt (see Session 31 below), links correctly to `https://demo.stalliq.co.uk`.
8. ~~Set `role: "owner"` on the Owner staff doc in both Firebase projects~~ ✓ Done 2026-05-10 — set on `vendors/demo/staff/{ownerId}` (stalliq dev) and `vendors/lamuletti/staff/{ownerId}` (stalliq-production).
9. ~~Deploy stalliq-site~~ ✓ Done 2026-05-10 — `stalliq-site/` deployed to Netlify Drop.
10. ~~Add `stalliq-site` to GitHub source control~~ ✓ Done 2026-05-10 — repo at `JulianBell106/stalliq-site` (`Documents\Engineering\stalliq-site`), public, linked to Netlify for auto-deploy on push to `main`.
11. **Generic code audit** ⚠️ High priority before scaling — audit `app.js`, `kitchen.js`, `index.html` (develop branch), and `css/styles.css` to remove hardcoded pizza/La Muletti references from the shared layer. All customer-specific text must flow through `CONFIG`. Do on a dedicated feature branch, test on both Street Stack (develop) and La Muletti (main) before merging. Do not rush — risky change.
12. ~~Rename Firebase `stalliq` project → `stalliq-development`~~ ✓ Done 2026-05-10 — display name updated in Firebase Console. Project ID unchanged; `js/firebase.js` on `develop` unaffected.

## Session 36 — 2026-05-12

**Scope:** Apply pending app.js audio fix to develop branch.

### Changes
- **app.js audio fix — develop** (`js/app.js`). `unlockAudio()`: `audioCtx.state === 'suspended'` → `!== 'running'` + `.catch(() => {})`. `playReadyBeep()`: `if (ctx.state === 'suspended') await ctx.resume()` → `if (ctx.state !== 'running') await ctx.resume().catch(() => {})`. Matches main. All iOS audio fixes now on both branches.

---
## Session 35 — 2026-05-11

- **Bug fix — iOS PIN inputs unresponsive in kitchen settings** (`kitchen.html`, both branches). `type="password"` + `inputmode="numeric"` is broken on iOS Safari — Safari ignores `inputmode` on password fields and the password autofill UI intercepts the first tap. Fix: changed all 6 PIN inputs (`add-staff-pin`, `add-staff-pin2`, `edit-staff-pin`, `edit-staff-pin2`, `forgot-newpin-input`, `forgot-newpin2-input`) to `type="text"` + `autocomplete="off"` + CSS `-webkit-text-security: disc` (masks digits visually). New class `staff-pin-input` added.

- **Bug fix — iOS kitchen not updating order status in real-time** (`js/kitchen.js`, both branches). iOS Safari silently drops Firestore "document modified" WebSocket events while still delivering "document added" events — so new orders appeared but status changes from other devices didn't. Fix: iOS heartbeat (`startIOSHeartbeat` / `stopIOSHeartbeat`) runs `get({source:'server'})` every 20s on iOS only. Uses direct server fetch rather than recreating the `onSnapshot` listener (listener recreation caused cache-first stale reads = one state behind, and disrupted the beep interval). Also fixed `visibilitychange` handler to chain `enableNetwork().finally(() => listenOrders())` instead of calling them independently. Detection: `_isIOS` flag covers iPad Pro (`platform === 'MacIntel'` + `maxTouchPoints > 1`).

- **Bug fix — loyalty discount missing from Order Placed modal** (`js/app.js`, both branches). `buildOrderSummaryHTML()` was called after `await resetUserStamps()`. `resetUserStamps()` triggers `listenUserProfile` which immediately zeroes `userStampCount`, so `getLoyaltyDiscount()` returned null and the discount row was absent. Fix: moved `buildOrderSummaryHTML()` call to before `resetUserStamps()` in both mobile (`mPlaceOrder`) and desktop (`dPlaceOrder`) flows.

- **Bug fix — iOS kitchen audio silent after screen lock** (`js/kitchen.js`, both branches). Three layered fixes:
  1. `_unlockKitchenAudio()` — if existing AudioContext is not `'running'` (iOS breaks it post-lock), close and discard it rather than trying to `resume()` (which silently fails). Create a fresh context. Also play a silent 1-sample buffer during the gesture — iOS requires audio to actually be played during the gesture to fully prime the pipeline for subsequent non-gesture beeps.
  2. `playOrderAlert()` — handle `'interrupted'` state (iOS on lock/call/Siri) same as `'suspended'`; always try `resume()` if not `'running'`, show restore banner if `resume()` fails.
  3. Result: after screen lock/unlock, the red "🔔 New order — tap to restore sound alerts" banner appears; one tap now reliably restores audio without needing a page refresh.

- **app.js audio fix — both branches** (`js/app.js`). `unlockAudio()` and `playReadyBeep()` updated to handle `'interrupted'` AudioContext state (not just `'suspended'`). Applied to main (Session 35) and develop (Session 36).

---

## Session 34 — 2026-05-10

- **Endoo branding added to `stalliq-site/index.html`** — two placements:
  1. **Footer** — full-width ruled row below the copyright line: "A product of [Endoo logo] — Endoo Limited, registered in England & Wales". Logo links to `https://www.endoo.co.uk`.
  2. **CTA section** — trust sentence below the demo buttons: "Stalliq is built and operated by [Endoo Limited](https://www.endoo.co.uk) — a UK technology company based in Milton Keynes."
- **`endoo-logo.png` added to `stalliq-site/`** — resized from `Endoo_Logo_BestOf_110mm.png` (1299×434px) to 239×80px (13 KB), RGBA PNG. Displayed at 20px height via CSS. Cream/gold coloured logo on transparent background — renders correctly on the midnight dark background.
- **Netlify auto-deploy confirmed working** — `stalliq-site` Netlify project now properly linked to `JulianBell106/stalliq-site` GitHub repo. Push to `main` → auto-deploys to `stalliq.co.uk`.
- **Future session planned** — write a Stalliq product page for `endoo.co.uk` under Products to cross-reference from the Stalliq site.

---

## Session 33 — 2026-05-10 (continued)

- **Feature — FSA Food Hygiene Rating badge** (`index.html` + `js/config.js`, both branches). Gold circle showing rating score + "Very Good" label renders in the desktop footer. CONFIG-driven: `CONFIG.fsa.rating` (0–5 or `null` to hide). Script placed after `config.js` loads to avoid timing issue. Font: DM Sans on the score numeral. La Muletti: `rating: 5`. Street Stack demo: `rating: 5` (for demo purposes). ⚠️ develop `config.js` had null bytes — stripped on write.
- **Backlog done — stalliq-site to GitHub** (`JulianBell106/stalliq-site`, public). Moved to `Documents\Engineering\stalliq-site`. Linked to Netlify for auto-deploy on push to `main`. Old `stalliq-site/` folder inside La Muletti to be deleted manually.
- **Firebase rename** — `stalliq` project display name → `stalliq-development`. Project ID unchanged.

---

## Session 32 — 2026-05-10

- **B1 done — stalliq-site demo section rebuilt** (`stalliq-site/index.html`). Section title: "See both sides of every order." Two-panel layout: customer panel (CSS phone + ghost CTA → `demo.stalliq.co.uk`) and kitchen panel (CSS phone with animated order cycling New → Confirmed → Ready on 11s loop, primary teal CTA → `demo.stalliq.co.uk/kitchen.html`, demo PIN `123456`). Mobile-responsive: panels stack vertically. ⚠️ Deploy pending — drag `stalliq-site/` onto Netlify Drop.
- **Bug fix — desktop events not rendering** (`js/app.js`, both branches). Root cause: `renderEventsList` fired before sheet data loaded and was never called again post-load. Fix: added `renderEventsList(...)` call in the post-`Promise.all` block, after `renderMobileFindUs()`.
- **Bug fix — kitchen.html `:root` flashing La Muletti colours on Street Stack** (`kitchen.html`, develop only). Fixed `:root` CSS vars to Street Stack teal values.
- **Bug fix — Street Stack privacy.html showed La Muletti branding** (`privacy.html`, develop only). Completely rewritten for Street Stack palette and contact details.
- **B2 done — Live Broadcast race condition fixed** (`js/kitchen.js`, both branches). Stale GPS resolves after `stopLocationBroadcast()` were overwriting `active: false`. Fix: `broadcastStopRequested` boolean flag set on stop, cleared on start, checked inside the GPS callback before any Firestore write.
- **Feature — Staff role management** (`kitchen.html` + `js/kitchen.js`, both branches). `role: 'owner' | 'staff'` field in Firestore staff docs. Owners see all staff + add/edit/remove controls. Staff see own row only. Max 2 owners enforced in code + UI. Role set via Firebase Console at onboarding — no in-app promotion. `loggedInStaffRole` state variable + `sessionStorage` persistence. ⚠️ Julian must manually set `role: "owner"` on the Owner staff doc in both Firebase projects before demo.
- **Firebase Auth fix** — `demo.stalliq.co.uk` added to authorised domains on `stalliq` dev project (manual, Julian). Phone auth was failing on Street Stack demo.

---

## Session 31 — 2026-05-10

- **stalliq-site rebuilt** — replaced "coming soon" splash with full marketing site: sticky nav, hero, proof bar, spotlight carousel (Flash Sales / WhatsApp Messaging / Geofence Loyalty with animated visuals), feature bento grid (hairline-separated cells, inline SVG icons — no emojis), CSS phone mockups (customer + kitchen views side by side), CTA, footer. Gradient section dividers throughout.
- **ImprovMX email** — `hello@stalliq.co.uk` → `info@endoo.co.uk`, catch-all → `julian@endoo.co.uk`. MX + SPF records added to Netlify DNS. ✓ Working.
- **stalliq-site not yet deployed or on GitHub** — drag `stalliq-site/` folder onto Netlify Drop to publish; see backlog B3 for source control.

---

## Pre-production backlog

~~**B1 — stalliq.co.uk: Show kitchen dashboard more prominently**~~ ✓ Done Session 32 — full two-panel demo section with animated kitchen card and both CTAs. See Session 32 below.

~~**B2 — La Muletti: Live Broadcast re-enables itself (intermittent bug)**~~ ✓ Fixed Session 32 — `broadcastStopRequested` flag prevents stale GPS resolves from overwriting the stop. Applied to both branches.

## Domain & Hosting Architecture

| URL | Netlify Site | Branch | Firebase | Purpose |
|-----|-------------|--------|----------|---------|
| `stalliq.co.uk` | stalliq (stalliq.netlify.app) | — | — | Stalliq product marketing/coming soon |
| `demo.stalliq.co.uk` | stalliq-demo | `develop` | `stalliq` (sandbox) | Generic demo — configured ✓ 2026-05-09 |
| `lamuletti-stalliq.netlify.app` | lamuletti | `main` | `stalliq-production` | La Muletti live system |

**DNS:** stalliq.co.uk uses Netlify DNS. Nameservers: `dns1-4.p05.nsone.net` (set in HostPapa 2026-05-04).
**Email:** ImprovMX handles `@stalliq.co.uk`. MX records in Netlify DNS. `hello@` → `info@endoo.co.uk`, `*@` → `julian@endoo.co.uk`. ✓ Working 2026-05-10.
**Future vendors** will get `[vendor].stalliq.co.uk` subdomains — Netlify DNS makes this trivial.

---

## Environment Architecture

| Branch | Netlify Site | Firebase Project | Purpose |
|--------|-------------|-----------------|---------|
| `develop` | stalliq-demo.netlify.app / demo.stalliq.co.uk | `stalliq` (dev sandbox) | All active development + Street Stack demo |
| `main` | lamuletti-stalliq.netlify.app | `stalliq-production` | La Muletti live system |

**Key files:**
- `.gitattributes` — protects `js/firebase.js` and `js/config.js` with `merge=ours` — **NOT index.html**
- `js/firebase.js` — branch-specific: dev creds on `develop`, production creds on `main`
- `js/config.js` — customer-specific: Street Stack on `develop`, La Muletti on `main`

**⚠️ index.html is NOT protected by .gitattributes.** Merging develop → main WILL overwrite La Muletti's CSS vars. Never merge index.html. Apply all UX changes to both branches separately.

**Merge workflow:** finish on `develop` → test on demo.stalliq.co.uk → apply same generic changes to `main` directly → push → lamuletti-stalliq auto-deploys.

---

## Branch divergence (intentional as of Session 30, updated Session 32)

| | `develop` (Street Stack) | `main` (La Muletti) |
|--|--|--|
| `:root` CSS vars | Street Stack teal (corrected Session 32) | La Muletti fire/gold/cream |
| `kitchen.html` `:root` | Street Stack teal (fixed Session 32 — was flashing La Muletti colours) | La Muletti fire/gold/cream |
| `privacy.html` | Street Stack branding (rewritten Session 32) | La Muletti branding |
| Desktop card height | 180px | 220px |
| Mobile card img height | 140px | 170px |
| Mobile img position | `center center` | `center 60%` |
| `.m-menu-card.no-image` CSS | present | not needed yet (all items have images) |
| No-image card template | Vertical with `.m-card-footer` | Side-by-side (original) |

---

## Architecture — File Overview

**7 files — all live on Netlify**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `index.html` | Customer app — ALL styles in embedded `<style>` block |
| `css/styles.css` | Legacy mobile-only styles — do NOT edit for desktop |
| `js/config.js` | All customer-specific data — only file that changes per customer |
| `js/firebase.js` | Firebase init — branch-specific credentials |
| `js/app.js` | All customer-side logic (~3520+ lines) |
| `kitchen.html` | Kitchen dashboard — PIN protected |
| `js/kitchen.js` | All kitchen logic (~2120+ lines) |

**⚠️ Desktop CSS lives in `index.html` `<style>` block — NOT in css/styles.css**

**Firestore:** always use compat SDK pattern (`db.collection().doc().onSnapshot()`) — never modular destructuring.

**Kitchen Firebase isolation:** `kitchen.js` uses a named app instance (`firebase.initializeApp(config, 'kitchen')`) → `kitchenAuth` + `kitchenDb`. App Check activated on both.

**Firestore staff doc schema** (`vendors/{vendorId}/staff/{staffId}`):
```
name:      string
pinHash:   string   (SHA-256 hex of PIN+salt)
pinSalt:   string   (random hex — missing = '' for backward compat)
active:    boolean
createdAt: timestamp
role:      string   ('owner' | 'staff') — added Session 32. Missing = treated as 'staff'. Max 2 owners. Set via Firebase Console at onboarding.
```

---

## CONFIG-driven architecture

All vendor-specific text is driven from `js/config.js`. Key CONFIG fields:

- `CONFIG.business.name` / `nameShort` / `type` (e.g. `'pizzas'`, `'burgers'`) / `stampIcon`
- `CONFIG.howItWorks` — `{ eyebrow, title, steps: [{title, desc}] }` — renders in desktop How It Works section
- `CONFIG.ordering.paymentNote` — shown in menu sub-header
- `CONFIG.menuSheetUrl` / `eventsSheetUrl` / `offersSheetUrl` — Google Sheets CSV URLs
- If `offersSheetUrl` is blank → `loyaltyConfig = null` → stamp card hidden entirely (correct behaviour)

## Commercial

**La Muletti deal:** Free Year 1 → 50% off for life from Year 2 (Founding Customer)
**Daniele confirmed he wants to go ahead — April 2026**

**Sophie (sophieetc.com):** MK food blogger — referral partner plan post-La Muletti data (Month 4-5). Commission: 20% of gross monthly subscription, 24 months per customer, then full margin.

---

## Large File Editing Rules

- `app.js` and `index.html` — patch via Python string replace only, never Edit tool directly
- Always verify JS with `node --check` after every change
- ⚠️ app.js on develop has null bytes — strip first: `tr -d '\000' < app.js > /tmp/app_clean.js`
- ⚠️ Always write large files using Python binary mode `open(dest, 'wb').write(data)` and verify size. Direct `cp` to Windows mount truncates large files.
- ⚠️ Never use apostrophes/contractions inside single-quoted JS strings in config.js

---
